# intraparty-analyses

NOTE: intra-party polarization results have to be estimated again, found an error in code


1. Added new variables to MP data (profession, education, year of birth)

2. Descriptive figures for gender, white-collar profession, higher education, and age

3. Intra-party polarization figures (gender, Helsinki-based, old vs. young, higher educ, etc.)
